## Chapter 01: Before the Advent of database systems

### Disadvantages of the file-based approach

- **Data redundancy**, a situation that occurs in a database when a field needs to be updated in more than one table
- **Data inconsistency**, a situation where various copies of the same data are conflicting, wastes storage space and duplicates effort
- **Data isolation**  is a property that determines when and how changes made by one operation become visible to other concurrent users and systems.
- Integrity problems
- Security problems
- **Concurrency:** the ability of the database to allow multiple users access to the same record without adversely affecting transaction processing

## Chapter 02: Fundamental Concepts

### Database Management System

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain databases and control all access to them. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information.

## Chapter 04: Types of Data Models 

- hierarchical model: represents data as a hierarchical tree structure
- network model: represents data as record types
- relation: another term for table
- relational model: represents data as relations or tables

## Chapter 05: Data Modelling 

Data modelling is the first step in the process of database design. This step is sometimes considered to be a high-level and abstract design phase, also referred to as conceptual design. The aim of this phase is to describe:

- The data contained in the database (e.g., entities: students, lecturers, courses, subjects)
- The relationships between data items (e.g., students are supervised by lecturers; lecturers teach courses)
- The constraints on data (e.g., student number has exactly eight digits; a subject has four or six units of credit only)

### Schemas

A schema is an overall description of a database, and it is usually represented by the entity relationship diagram (ERD).
